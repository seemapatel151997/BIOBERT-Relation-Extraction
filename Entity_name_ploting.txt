Entity Types of Relation Extraction Datasets:

	Datasets and its input entity types:

	Dataset name: BioNLP
	Entity Names: Protein, Entity (Non-Protein) 
	Relation Names: (Note: Arg1=Protein, Arg2=Entity)
		- Subunit-Complex(Arg1-Arg2): Subunit-Complex is a Component-Object relation that holds between a protein complex and its subunits, individual proteins.
		- Protein-Component(Arg1-Arg2) : Protein-Component is a less specific Object-Component relation that holds between a gene/protein and its component, such as a protein domain or the promoter of a gene.

	Dataset name: ChemProt
	Entity Names: CHEMICAL, GENE-Y, GENE-N
	Relation Names: PRODUCT-OF, ANTAGONIST, SUBSTRATE, ACTIVATOR, INHIBITOR, INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR, INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR, AGONIST, PART-OF, DIRECT-REGULATOR, AGONIST-ACTIVATOR, AGONIST-INHIBITOR, SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF
